## Key Features

- ðŸ“‰ View a graph of one to three linear or angular accelerations as a function of time made
  with [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/)
- ðŸ•™ Acquire for an indefinite, definite or rolling period of time
- ðŸ’¾ Export the result to a file in :
    - PNG format [IN DEVELOPMENT]
    - CSV format
- ðŸŽ² 3D models to help you navigate in spatial directions in reference to your device made
  with [Spline](https://spline.design/)


- [IN DEVELOPMENT]
    - Translate into English, *currently the application is mostly in French*
    - organize and comment the code, optimize some parts
    - be able to acquire the speed and the relative position of the device *(tests in progress
      with [Kalman filters like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter)
      and [Inertial measurement unit like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_measurement_unit))*

## How To Install

### Option 1: Binary

Accelerometer Application is currently available on Android and will be available on IOS a little later.

You can download the latest binary from the [Release page](https://github.com/Raserber/accelerometer-application/releases)

### Option 2: From Source

- [Ios](https://ionicframework.com/docs/developing/ios)

## How to Contribute

Contributions welcome!

first, clone the repository and install dependencies :

```shell
git clone git@github.com:Raserber/accelerometer-application.git
cd accelerometer-application/
npm install
```

To run application in browser as http://localhost:8080/ (usually) like any project brings [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) :

```shell
npm run serve
```
