# accelerometer application

> An Application to experiment accelerations for an educational purpose.

[Accelerometer](https://github.com/Raserber/) is a mobile application build with [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/), [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/)
and [Vue](https://vuejs.org) as frameworks to use the phone's motion sensors to capture linear and angular accelerations and display them for an educational purpose.

## Origin Of The Creation

It is to realize a TP in school with the problematic: *"Measuring the speed and acceleration of the
[Zumo robot](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/972230493871427735/972230636964315216/unknown.png)
with a smartphone embedded and programmed via [MIT App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/)."*

So I thought it's to easy, and also a bit ugly.  
I chose to redo it by improving it in a language that I mastered.  
As I didn't master Java enough to pretend to do mobile development with it.  
I decided to use Javascript,
and more precisely [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) and [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/), that I had already used before.


I also decided to improve the basic concept of displaying one
or several linear or angular accelerations with notably :

- a graph of acceleration(s) as a function of time
- Be able to export these data in CSV, PNG or JPG formats
- Be able to display speed as a function of time of the device
